# Scrape-the-News

A web app that lets users view and save articles, as well as leave comments and delete comments on the latest news (thanks to Mongoose and Cheerio).

App is live [here](https://npr-newscrape.herokuapp.com/)!

Future updates
  1. Warnings when deleting saved article or a comment
  2. Make it so comments can't be empty strings (when adding a comment)
  3. Show how many comments an article has on the saved-articles page
  4. Implement the "User" collection to allow comments to belong to users
  5. Display the User that made a comment
  6. Parallel #4/#5 with saved-articles
